## Carrot Cake

This originally came from pages 679-680 of the Silver Palatte New Basics cookbook, “Berta's Carrot Cake”, but I made some modifications:

1 cup AP flour 1 cup WW flour 2 cups granulated sugar (it's definitely possible that I cut this by a third to a half, but I know it's good without cutting it) 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 cup neutrally flavored oil 3 flax eggs (3 tablespoons ground flax + 9 tablespoons water, set aside in the fridge for 15 minutes) 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/3 cup pumpkin or butternut puree 1 cup chopped walnuts, roasted 1 cup shredded carrots 3/4 cup canned crushed pineapple

\1. preheat oven to 350F. prep either a 13 x 9 inch layer cake pan, or two 8 inch cake pans. 2. sift the flour, sugar, baking soda and cinnamon together in a large bowl. add the oil, flax eggs and vanilla and beat until uniformly mixed. fold in all other ingredients. 3. pour batter in prepped pan(s), bake until the edges have pulled away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. OPTIONAL: at this point, I had zested and then juiced some clementines and made a symple syrup with the juice and brushed it over the cake. mix the zest and sugar together to go on top of the cake. 4. cool for 10 minutes, then invert pan, unmold cake and remove the wax paper. let cool completely. 5. frost the top and sides, toss some crumbled walnuts (and the aforementioned zest) on top.

for frosting, I originally just made a cream cheese frosting as follows:

4 ounces tofutti 3 tablespoons earth balance buttery stick 1 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla juice of 1/4 lemon

cream the fats together, sift int he sugar and beat until fully incorporated. stir in the flavoring.

BUT, I've never been a fan of these confectioner's sugar based frosting, I think they have kind of a gross flavor. I recently came across a thickened milk frosting from my mom and then found out some more info on it from this site:

this frosting is REALLY good. the version I made is was with almond milk. make sure you sift the flour into the milk, I had some clumps because I was lazy.

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.
